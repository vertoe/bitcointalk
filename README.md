    -----BEGIN LTC SIGNED MESSAGE-----
    i'm vertoe and no longer able to access my bitcointalk account - verify this message with the litecoin address found in this post ?topic=441215.msg4847316 - the last post written by me is ?topic=400389.msg11381772 - yes, i never wanted cachecoin 2.0 and allowed the extended cachecoin team to use my account - i couldn't stand the pressure of investors sending me daily half a dozen pms on all channels - screw the altcoin scene - i'm out anyways - and kal, sorry for breaking your coin while trying to rescue it. farewell.
